How to implement BLOC
*********************


BLOC
****
The Events are generated from the User/UI ,
The BLOC gives the response in the form of states.


BLOC Provider:- BLOC Provider provides the BLOC to the Children.
BLOC Builder:- BLOC builder helps in Re-building the UI
 BLOC Builder has one Property
    buildWhen: whenever this buildWhen is true ,then only the widget will be built sucessfully.
               By default it returnsm true.

BLOC Consumer :-This widget is used to
                    a)ReBuild the UI/ Navigate to another activity
                    b)Display a Dialog/Toast/

If we want to combine the functionality of
                    BLOC builder
                    BLOC listner
                    then we should go for BLOC Consumer.

BLOC Selector :- BLOC Selector is used to filter the Object based on the current state of the BLOC.
