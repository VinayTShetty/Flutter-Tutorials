How to implement BLOC
*********************


BLOC
****
The Events are generated from the User/UI ,
The BLOC gives the response in the form of states.


BLOC Provider:- BLOC Provider provides the BLOC to the Children.
BLOC Builder:- BLOC builder helps in Re-building the UI
 BLOC Builder has one Property
    buildWhen: whenever this buildWhen is true ,then only the widget will be built sucessfully.
               By default it returnsm true.

BLOC listner :- This widget will be used to listen to different state that is generated from the BLOC.
                Based on the states we can generate
                 Toast
                 SnackBar
                 We can navigagte to different screen.

                 Please note:-It will never rebuild the UI/VIew

                 BLOC listner has on more widget.

                 listenWhen :- It will return true or false.
                 If true listner will be called,
                 If false listner will not be called.
